	abstract = {We study the problem of treatment eﬀect estimation in randomized experiments with high-dimensional covariate information, and show that essentially any risk-consistent regression adjustment can be used to obtain eﬃcient estimates of the average treatment eﬀect. Our results considerably extend the range of settings where high-dimensional regression adjustments are guaranteed to provide valid inference about the population average treatment eﬀect. We then propose cross-estimation, a simple method for obtaining ﬁnite-sample-unbiased treatment eﬀect estimates that leverages high-dimensional regression adjustments. Our method can be used when the regression model is estimated using the lasso, the elastic net, subset selection, etc. Finally, we extend our analysis to allow for adaptive speciﬁcation search via cross-validation, and ﬂexible non-parametric regression adjustments with machine learning methods such as random forests or neural networks.},

	abstract = {{OBJECTIVE}—To evaluate the impact of primary care group visits (chronic care clinics) on the process and outcome of care for diabetic patients.
{RESEARCH} {DESIGN} {AND} {METHODS}—We evaluated the intervention in primary care practices randomized to intervention and control groups in a large-staff model health maintenance organization ({HMO}). Patients included diabetic patients ≥30 years of age in each participating primary care practice, selected at random from an automated diabetes registry. Primary care practices were randomized within clinics to either a chronic care clinic (intervention) group or a usual care (control) group. The intervention group conducted periodic one-half day chronic care clinics for groups of ∼8 diabetic patients in their respective doctor’s practice. Chronic care clinics consisted of standardized assessments; visits with the primary care physician, nurse, and clinical pharmacist; and a group education/peer support meeting. We collected self-report questionnaires from patients and data from administrative systems. The questionnaires were mailed, and telephoned interviews were conducted for nonrespondents, at baseline and at 12 and 24 months; we queried the process of care received, the satisfaction with care, and the health status of each patient. Serum cholesterol and {HbA}1c levels and health care use and cost data was collected from {HMO} administrative systems.
{RESULTS}—In an intention-to-treat analysis at 24 months, the intervention group had received significantly more recommended preventive procedures and helpful patient education. Of five primary health status indicators examined, two ({SF}-36 general health and bed disability days) were significantly better in the intervention group. Compared with control patients, intervention patients had slightly more primary care visits, but significantly fewer specialty and emergency room visits. Among intervention participants, we found consistently positive associations between the number of chronic care clinics attended and a number of outcomes, including patient satisfaction and {HbA}1c levels.
{CONCLUSIONS}—Periodic primary care sessions organized to meet the complex needs of diabetic patients improved the process of diabetes care and were associated with better outcomes.},

	abstract = {Background and Objectives In the last few years there has been a steady uptake of mobile phone short message service ({SMS}) reminders to increase medical attendance rates. We undertook a review of studies that assessed the effectiveness of {SMS} reminders at increasing the uptake of appointments in health care settings. Methods We reviewed studies which involved a comparison of appointment attendance rates between patients who did and did not receive {SMS} reminders published prior to June 2010. We used meta-analysis methods to calculate the overall effect on attendance rates, stratified by study design and clinic type. Results The review criteria were met by 18 reports, made up of eight randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) and 10 controlled observational studies. Across all studies, there was significant heterogeneity in the estimated effect measure of the relationship between use of {SMS} reminders and clinic attendance (I2 = 90 percent; p {\textless} .01), so a summary effect estimate was not calculated. Stratification by study design showed that the heterogeneity was due to the observational studies. The summary effect from the {RCTs} was 1.48 (95\% {CI}: 1.23–1.72) with no significant subgroup differences by clinic type (primary care clinics, hospital outpatient clinics), message timing (24, 48, and 72+ hours before the scheduled appointment), and target age group (pediatric, older). Conclusions Short message service reminders in health care settings substantially increase the likelihood of attending clinic appointments. {SMS} reminders appear to be a simple and efficient option for health services to use to improve service delivery, as well as resulting in health benefits for the patients who receive the reminders.},

	abstract = {Summary
Background
Unnecessary antibiotic prescribing contributes to antimicrobial resistance. In this trial, we aimed to reduce unnecessary prescriptions of antibiotics by general practitioners ({GPs}) in England.
Methods
In this randomised, 2 × 2 factorial trial, publicly available databases were used to identify {GP} practices whose prescribing rate for antibiotics was in the top 20\% for their National Health Service ({NHS}) Local Area Team. Eligible practices were randomly assigned (1:1) into two groups by computer-generated allocation sequence, stratified by {NHS} Local Area Team. Participants, but not investigators, were blinded to group assignment. On Sept 29, 2014, every {GP} in the feedback intervention group was sent a letter from England's Chief Medical Officer and a leaflet on antibiotics for use with patients. The letter stated that the practice was prescribing antibiotics at a higher rate than 80\% of practices in its {NHS} Local Area Team. {GPs} in the control group received no communication. The sample was re-randomised into two groups, and in December, 2014, {GP} practices were either sent patient-focused information that promoted reduced use of antibiotics or received no communication. The primary outcome measure was the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 weighted population, controlling for past prescribing. Analysis was by intention to treat. This trial is registered with the {ISRCTN} registry, number {ISRCTN}32349954, and has been completed.
Findings
Between Sept 8 and Sept 26, 2014, we recruited and assigned 1581 {GP} practices to feedback intervention (n=791) or control (n=790) groups. Letters were sent to 3227 {GPs} in the intervention group. Between October, 2014, and March, 2015, the rate of antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population was 126·98 (95\% {CI} 125·68–128·27) in the feedback intervention group and 131·25 (130·33–132·16) in the control group, a difference of 4·27 (3·3\%; incidence rate ratio [{IRR}] 0·967 [95\% {CI} 0·957–0·977]; p{\textless}0·0001), representing an estimated 73 406 fewer antibiotic items dispensed. In December, 2014, {GP} practices were re-assigned to patient-focused intervention (n=777) or control (n=804) groups. The patient-focused intervention did not significantly affect the primary outcome measure between December, 2014, and March, 2015 (antibiotic items dispensed per 1000 population: 135·00 [95\% {CI} 133·77–136·22] in the patient-focused intervention group and 133·98 [133·06–134·90] in the control group; {IRR} for difference between groups 1·01, 95\% {CI} 1·00–1·02; p=0·105).
Interpretation
Social norm feedback from a high-profile messenger can substantially reduce antibiotic prescribing at low cost and at national scale; this outcome makes it a worthwhile addition to antimicrobial stewardship programmes.

	abstract = {Background
The {NHS} Health Check ({NHS} {HC}) is a cardiovascular risk assessment to prevent cardiovascular disease. Public Health England ({PHE}) wants to increase uptake.

Methods
We explored the impact of behaviourally informed invitation letters and pre-notification and reminder {SMS} on uptake of {NHS} {HCs}. Patients at 28 General Practices in the London Borough of Southwark who were eligible to receive an {NHS} {HC} between 1st November 2013 and 31st December 2014 were included. A double-blind randomised controlled trial with a mixed 2 (pre-notification {SMS} – yes or no) × 4 (letter – national template control, open-ended, time-limited, social norm) × 2 (reminder {SMS} – yes or no) factorial design was used. The open-ended letter used simplification, behavioural instruction and a personalised planning prompt for patients to record the date and time of their {NHS} {HC}. The time-limited letter was similar but stated the {NHS} {HC} was due in a named forthcoming month. The social norms letter was similar to the open-ended letter but included a descriptive social norms message and testimonials from local residents and no planning prompt. The outcome measure was attendance at an {NHS} {HC}.

Results
Data for 12, 244 invites were analysed. Uptake increased in almost all letter and {SMS} combinations compared to the control letter without {SMS} (Uptake 18\%), with increases of up to 12 percentage points for the time-limited letter with pre-notification and reminder (Uptake 30\%; Adjusted Odds Ratio {AOR} 1.86; 95\% {CI} 1.45–2.83; p {\textless} 0.00); 10 percentage points for the open-ended letter with reminder (Uptake 27\%; {AOR} 1.68; 95\% {CI} 1.31–2.17; p {\textless} 0.00) and a 9 percentage point increase using the time-limited letter with reminder (Uptake 27\%; {AOR} 1.61; 95\% {CI} 1.25–2.10; p {\textless} 0.00). The reminder {SMS} increased uptake for all intervention letters. The pre-notification did not add to this effect.

Conclusions
This large randomised controlled trial adds support to the evidence that small, low cost behaviourally informed changes to letter-based invitations can increase uptake of {NHS} {HCs}. It also provides novel evidence on the effect of {SMS} reminders and pre-notification on {NHS} {HC} attendance.

	abstract = {{BACKGROUND}: Excellent diabetes care and self-management depends heavily on the flow of timely, accurate information to patients and providers. Recent developments in information technology ({IT}) may, therefore, hold great promise. {OBJECTIVE}: To determine, in a systematic review, how emerging interactive {IT} has been used to enhance care for adults with type 2 diabetes. {METHOD}: Eligible studies were randomized controlled trials ({RCTs}) and observational studies (both before-after designs and post-intervention assessments) focused on computer-assisted interactive {IT} that included ≥10 adults with diabetes (≥50\% type 2) and reported in English. We searched 4 electronic databases (up to 2003) using terms for diabetes and technology, reviewed bibliographies, and handsearched Diabetes Care (January 1990 to February 2004). Two reviewers independently selected articles and worked serially on data extraction with adjudication of discrepancies by consensus. {RESULTS}: There were 26 studies (27 reports): internet (n=6; 3 {RCTs}), telephone (n=7; 4 {RCTs}), and computer-assisted integration of clinical information (n=13, 7 {RCTs}). The median (range) sample size was 165 (28 to 6,469 participants) for patients and 37 (15 to 67) for providers; the median duration was 6 (1 to 29) months. Ethnic minorities or underserved populations were described in only 8 studies. Six of 14 interventions demonstrated moderate to large significant declines in hemoglobin A1c levels compared with controls. Most studies reported overall positive results and found that {IT}-based interventions improved health care utilization, behaviors, attitudes, knowledge, and skills. {CONCLUSIONS}: There is growing evidence that emerging {IT} may improve diabetes care. Future research should characterize benefits in the long term ({\textgreater}1 year), establish methods to evaluate clinical outcomes, and determine the cost-effectiveness of using {IT}.},

Background: Promoting improved self-management for those with diabetes and a cardiac condition is enhanced by raising motivation and providing a model. Peer support from former patients who are able to successfully manage similar conditions could enhance patient motivation to achieve better health outcomes and provide a model of how such management can be achieved. While studies on peer support have demonstrated the potential of peers in promoting self-management, none have examined the impact on patients with two co-morbidities. Methods: A randomized controlled trial was used to develop and evaluate the effectiveness of the Peer-{CDSMP} from August 2009 to December 2010. Thirty cardiac patients with type 2 diabetes were recruited. The study commenced in an acute hospital, follow-up at participants' homes in Brisbane, Australia. Results: While both the control and intervention groups had improved self-care behaviour, self-efficacy and knowledge, the improvement in knowledge was significantly greater for the intervention group. Conclusions: Significant improvement in knowledge was achieved for the intervention group. Absence of significant improvements in self-efficacy and self-care behaviour represents an inconclusive effect; further studies with larger sample sizes are recommended.},

	abstract = {The recent introduction of digital health into generating demand for health commodities and services has provided practitioners with an expanded universe of potential tools to strengthen demand and ensure service delivery receipt. However, considerable gaps remain in our understanding of which interventions are effective, which characteristics mediate their benefit for different target populations and health domains, and what is necessary to ensure effective deployment. This paper first provides an overview of the types of digital health interventions for demand generation, including untargeted client communication, client-to-client communication, on-demand information services, personal health tracking, client financial transactions, and targeted client communication. It then provides a general overview of 118 studies published between January 1, 2010, and October 3, 2017, that used digital interventions to generate demand for health interventions. The majority (61\%) of these studies used targeted client communication to provide health education or reminders to improve treatment adherence, and the most frequently (27\%) studied health condition was {HIV}/{AIDS}. Intervention characteristics that have been found to have some effect on gains in demand generation include modality, directionality, tailoring, phrasing, and schedule. The paper also explores new emergent digital approaches that expand the potential effect of traditional demand generation in terms of personalization of content and services, continuity of care, and accountability tracking. Applying existing frameworks for monitoring and evaluation and reporting, research on emerging approaches will need to consider not only their feasibility but also their effectiveness in achieving demand generation outcomes. We propose a research agenda to help guide the field of digital demand generation studies and programs within a broader health systems strengthening agenda, including establishing and documenting the influence of intervention characteristics within different populations and health domains and examining the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of digital demand generation interventions, as well as equity in access to such interventions.},

We ﬁnd that around 80\% of the eligible receive the subsidy as intended, and up to 15\% of subsidies are leaked to ineligible people. Supplementing the program with simple ﬁnancial or monitoring incentives for health workers does not improve performance further and is thus not cost-eﬀective in this context.},

	shorttitle = {Providers and women’s perspectives on person-centered maternity care},
	abstract = {Background: Globally, there has been increasing attention to women’s experiences of care and calls for a personcentered care approach. At the heart of this approach is the patient-provider relationship. It is necessary to examine the extent to which providers and women agree on the care that is provided and received. Studies have found that incongruence between women’s and providers’ perceptions may negatively impact women’s compliance, satisfaction, and future use of health facilities. However, there are no studies that examine patient and provider perspectives on person-centered care.
Methods: To fill this gap in the literature, we use cross-sectional data of 531 women and 33 providers in seven government health facilities in Kenya to assess concordance and discordance in person-centered care measures. Additionally, we analyze 41 in-depth interviews with providers from three of these facilities to examine why differences in reporting may occur. Descriptive statistical methods were used to measure the magnitude of differences between reports of women and reports of providers. Thematic analyses were conducted for provider surveys.
Results: Our findings suggest high discordance between women and providers’ perspectives in regard to personcentered care experiences. On average, women reported lower levels of person-centered care compared to providers, including low respectful and dignified care, communication and autonomy, and supportive care. Providers were more likely to report higher rates of poor health facility environment such as having sufficient staff. We summarize the overarching reasons for the divergence in women and provider reports as: 1) different understanding or interpretation of person-centered care behaviors, and 2) different expectations, norms or values of provider behaviors. Providers rationalized abuse towards women, did not allow a companion of choice, and blamed women for poor patientprovider communication. Women lacked assurance in privacy and confidentiality, and faced challenges related to the health facility environment. Providers attributed poor person-centered care to both individual and facility/systemic factors.
Conclusions: Implications of this study suggests that providers should be trained on person-centered care approaches and women should be counseled on understanding patient rights and how to communicate with health professionals.},

	abstract = {Individuals care about how they are perceived by others, and take visible actions to signal their type. This paper investigates social signaling in the context of childhood immunization in Sierra Leone. Despite high initial vaccine take-up, many parents do not complete the ﬁve immunizations that are required in a child’s ﬁrst year of life. I introduce a durable signal - in the form of diﬀerently colored bracelets - which children receive upon vaccination, and implement a 22-month-long experiment in 120 public clinics. Informed by theory, the experimental design separately identiﬁes social signaling from leading alternative mechanisms. In a ﬁrst main ﬁnding, I show that individuals use signals to learn about others’ actions. Second, I ﬁnd that the impact of signals varies signiﬁcantly with the social desirability of the action. In particular, the signal has a weak eﬀect when linked to a vaccine with low perceived beneﬁts and a large, positive eﬀect when linked to a vaccine with high perceived beneﬁts. Of substantive policy importance, signals increase timely and complete vaccination at a cost of 1 {USD} per child, with eﬀects persisting 12 months after the roll out. Finally, I structurally estimate a dynamic discrete-choice model to quantify the value of social signaling.},

We ﬁnd the rank order of percentage change of shifts in demand matches theoretical predictions, although the differences are not statistically signiﬁcant, and only two of three pairwise comparisons match when the reductions are speciﬁed in percent terms.

Using nine weeks of daily data, we show that the barrier to optimal care seeking is cost, not information: subsidies increase demand by over 250\%, but overuse is rare with or without the subsidy.

Objective To measure the impact of Zindagi {SMS}, a two-way {SMS} reminder system, on treatment success of people with drug-sensitive tuberculosis. Design We conducted a two-arm, parallel design, effectiveness randomized controlled trial in Karachi, Pakistan. Individual participants were randomized to either Zindagi {SMS} or the control group. Zindagi {SMS} sent daily {SMS} reminders to participants and asked them to respond through {SMS} or missed (unbilled) calls after taking their medication. Non-respondents were sent up to three reminders a day. Setting Public and private sector tuberculosis clinics in Karachi, Pakistan. Participants Newly-diagnosed patients with smear or bacteriologically positive pulmonary tuberculosis who were on treatment for less than two weeks; 15 years of age or older; reported having access to a mobile phone; and intended to live in Karachi throughout treatment were eligible to participate. We enrolled 2,207 participants, with 1,110 randomized to Zindagi {SMS} and 1,097 to the control group. Main Outcome The primary outcome was clinically recorded treatment success based upon intention-to-treat. Results We found no significant difference between the Zindagi {SMS} or control groups for treatment success (719 or 83\% vs. 903 or 83\%, respectively, p = 0·782).

	abstract = {Using a biometric technology to monitor the attendance of public health workers in India resulted in a 15 percent increase in staff presence, particularly for lower-level staff. The monitoring program led to a reduction in low-birth weight babies, highlighting the importance of improving provider presence. But, despite the government initiating this reform, there was ultimately a low demand by the government to use the higher quality attendance data available in real time to enforce their existing human resource policies (e.g. leave or salary deductions) due to logistical challenges and a not unrealistic fear of generating staff discord or increase in staff attrition, especially among doctors, who showed the least improvement in attendance. While we observed some gains from this type of monitoring program, technological solutions by themselves will not improve attendance of government staff without a willingness to use the data generated to enforce existing penalties.},

	abstract = {Sexual health problems cause negative externalities from contagious diseases and public expenditure
burdens from teenage pregnancies. In a randomized evaluation, we find that an online sexual-health
education course in Colombia leads to significant impacts on knowledge and attitudes and, for those
already sexually active, fewer {STIs}. To go beyond self-reported measures, we provide condom vouchers
six months after the course, and find a 9 percentage point increase in redemption. We find no evidence
of spillovers to untreated classrooms, but we do observe a social reinforcement effect: the impact intensifies
when a larger fraction of a student’s friends is also treated.},
